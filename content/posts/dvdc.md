I recently gave a lightning talk at the [Data Visualization DC Meetup] (https://www.meetup.com/Data-Visualization-DC/). Good times had by all. Slides from the talk are [available here](https://www.beautiful.ai/player/-LfZBmbNm4VoBJ7tOniJ). For those interested in a longer discussion of Pandas, Altair, and policing, consider attending the [DC Python Meetup on June 25th](https://www.meetup.com/dcpython/events/261456267/).
