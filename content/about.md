I split my time between political consulting, data engineering, and software development. Often, those worlds collide.

In politics, I've worked on races from Town Council to U.S. Senate.

In the realm of programming, my specialties include:

* Python (2 & 3)
* Django and the related ecosystem (Django Rest Framework, Django-Social-Auth)
* Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Altair, and related data analysis and visualization libraries
* Web-scrapping with Requests, Scrapy, and BeautifulSoup
* Postgres and MySQL
* Static site generation (especially Hugo)

These interests have lately collided with the founding of [Legisltr LLC](https://www.legisltr.com), a startup aimed at providing timely access to current and historical legislative voting records to campaign professionals.
